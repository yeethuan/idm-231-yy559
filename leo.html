        ATTENTION THIS IS NOT A DRILL ATTENTION RIGHT NEOW. Leo, the celestial lion, mirrors the vibrant energy of Mirasol peppers. Just as Mirasol peppers grow towards the sun with their tips pointed upwards, Leos bask in the spotlight, embracing their royal status with vivacious charm and theatrical flair. They're passionate and playful, providing a pleasant warmth in relationships, and always adding a hint of excitement. They're dedicated friends and lovers, putting their hearts into every connection and cheering on their loved ones' success.

    </p>
        
    <p>
        Just as drying Mirasol peppers intensifies their flavor, Leos' deep wells of courage grow with maturity, making them fearless optimists who refuse to accept failure. Their bravery, like the divine expression of physical, mental, and emotional fortitude depicted in the "strength" card of tarot, is celebrated and admired by all who know them.</p>
