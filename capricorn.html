        Capy's UP. The Capricorn may seem reserved and conservative at first glance, but hidden beneath that serious exterior lies a mischievous troublemaker ready to shake things up. Much like the versatile jalapeno pepper, Capricorn's complexity surprises those who underestimate them.

        As you get to know them, just like jalapenos turning vibrant red when ripe, Capricorns reveal their true colors—vibrant, spicy, and full of flavor. Capricorn's closest friends and lovers know of their secret love for partying, so too do chefs and food enthusiasts appreciate the jalapeno's versatility in the kitchen. From adding a kick to hot sauces and salsas to being pickled and served as a condiment, or even grilled to bring out their smoky essence, jalapenos, like Capricorns, adapt to any situation with ease.
